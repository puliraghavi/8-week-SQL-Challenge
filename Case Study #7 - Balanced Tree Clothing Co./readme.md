````sql
select p.product_name as Product,
sum(s.qty) as Total_units_sold
from balanced_tree.sales s
left join balanced_tree.product_details p
on s.prod_id = p.product_id
group by 1
````

**2.What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?**
````sql
select p.product_name, sum(s.price)*sum(s.qty)
from balanced_tree.product_details p
join balanced_tree.sales s
on s.prod_id = p.product_id
group by 1
````
